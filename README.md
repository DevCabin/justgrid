# justgrid
Just the grid and a few optional defaults from Bootstrap for lightweight and rapid responsive layouts. 

This intended to make developingn responsive web sites easier and more efficient by using familiar syntax and functionality, but wihtout the bloat of default styless for buttons, tables, modals, galleries, etc. Bootstrap is great if you want to whip up something fast that looks OK and is funtional. But if you (like me) make responsive web sites based on far more creative designs than out of the box Bootstrap promotes, the bloat is not needed and can actually get in the way. 


## Includes

* The Grid (col-md-8, col-md-4 etc)
* Containers and Rows right from Twitter BS
* Normalize.css
* Opinionated defaults for typography (OPTIONAL)
* Helper classes (OPTIONAL)

If anyone has been following my projects, this replaces the now abandoned [g-grid](https://github.com/DevCabin/g-grid)
