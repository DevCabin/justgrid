# justgrid
Just the grid and a few optional defaults from Bootstrap for lightweight and rapid responsive layouts.

## Includes

* The Grid (col-md-8, col-md-4 etc)
* Containers and Rows right from Twitter BS
* Normalize.css
* Opinionated defaults for typography (OPTIONAL)
* Helper classes (OPTIONAL)

If anyone has been following my projects, this replaces the now abandoned [g-grid](https://github.com/DevCabin/g-grid)
